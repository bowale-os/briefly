during onboarding, i dont want to overload the user with preferences that they have to set...
we'll incorporate that into their eperience....


think sbout making user_id in intent and searchhistry optional....

the first sentence of the summary has arepitition from intro and sumamry beginning


users shiuld be able to see all their breifing display on a page
they should be able to see their search history..
they should be able to download mp3 of the breifings??
there should be analytics part to their experience..
Users should be able to search their old briefings,
they should be able to reedit a brefing and get a new one?
they should have briefing templates, is the persona method a good idea??
users should be able to save interests and filters,
they should be able to schedule posts, weekly or daily like a subscription
